# python data science beginnings
if you are following along and want to learn more about data science with python then you are at the right the right place!
this is a course for windows and linux machines.
here is where to install python:
[Python 3.12.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3125/)
this is my recommended version but yeah install that.
## day 1:
learning the beginnings.
## day 2:
doing sorting with built-in python lists.
## day 3:
### we start using .csv files today! 
and we will use these in the future for more advanced option's probably.
### but for now
we will use this for a simple age avrage finding program. this is really simple it adds all the ages of each line of the .csv file then divides them by the amount of lines.
(basically) but yeah we will use csv later on for more advanced sorting programs.
(who knows this might help you learn how to do a lot in python me too!)
## day 4:
we will make a simple grading program today. and update our undertsanding of other ways to use CSV files with python!
